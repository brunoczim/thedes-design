# Thede Land Claim

A map has a layer keepping track of what thede a tile belongs to;
or to no thede.
When a thede is generated,
all tiles belonging to the thede are claimed at this layer.

Thedes can expand their territory, either pacifically or through war.
In this case, more tiles will be claimed.

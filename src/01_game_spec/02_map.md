# Map

Thedes' worlds have a map, and the map has layers.
Such layers are:
- Biome
- Ground
- Block/item
- Thede land claim

The map is relatively small (compared to some open-world games),
having average width and height as around 1000 tiles (area of 1000 times 1000).
It is generated all at once, before the player enters into the map.

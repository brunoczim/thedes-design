# Map

Thedes' worlds have a map, and the map has layers.
Such layers are:
- biome
- ground
- block/item
- thede land claim

The map is relatively small (compared to some open-world games),
having average width and height as around 1000 tiles (area of 1000 times 1000).
It is generated all at once, before the player enters into the map.

The map has structures generated.
For instance, thedes will generate small villages.
